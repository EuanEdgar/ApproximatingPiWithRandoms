Inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBhSi_PwHU&ab_channel=Stand-upMaths) on approximating π from random numbers.
This program allows you to generate an approximation from by based on the fact that the probability of two random numbers not sharing a factor approaches 6 / π^2.
I have determined through rigorous trial and error that this is a terrible way to approximate π, and that I have probably done it wrong.
Still fun though.
